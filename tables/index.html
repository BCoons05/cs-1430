    <p>
        I chose most of these videos because they are hilarious parts of movies and shows that I quote pretty much daily. My family and I watch the office
        basically every day. I watched it when I was younger and rarely missed an episode. I think it will be a memory in my kids and my own minds for our entire lives.
        Hot Rod is a movie that one of my friends and I quote way too often, but it reminds me of a fun time in my life. Monty Python is just a classic. I remember
        watching that when I was younger and I didn;t totally get it but it was still good, now the first 30 minutes or so are firmly entrenched in my mind. The songs have 
        each been listened to on repeat at different crazy times in my life and still remind me of people and times in my life.
